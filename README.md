## Development build

To get the development build run the following command.

```sh
yarn build:dev
```

Then scan the QR code and install the build.

Once you have the development build, to run it on a physical device, run the following command.

```sh
yarn start:dev
```

Then scan the QR code and it will open the app.

Everytime a native module is added to the app, a new development build has to be created. Otherwise, you can just run the previous build.
